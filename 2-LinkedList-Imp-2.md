# Implementing a Linked List
## Linked List Class
Next, we define the LinkedList class, which represents the entire linked list. This class will have methods to perform various operations on the linked list.

````python
class LinkedList:
    def __init__(self):
        self.head = None
````
In the __init__ method, we initialize the head attribute to None. The head attribute keeps track of the first node in the linked list.
