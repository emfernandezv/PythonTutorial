# Introduction to Queue
## Definition
In the context of data structures, a Queue is an ordered collection that follows the FIFO (First-In-First-Out) principle. It operates similar to a real-world queue or line, where the first person to join the queue is the first one to be served.

## Characteristics of a Queue

* **Order**: Elements are stored and processed in a specific order. The element that has been in the queue for the longest time is always at the front, while the element that has been in the queue for the shortest time is at the rear.

* **FIFO Principle**: The first element added to the queue is the first one to be removed. New elements are always added to the rear, and removal occurs from the front.

* **Enqueue**: Adding an element to the rear of the queue is called enqueue. It increases the size of the queue.

* **Dequeue**: Removing an element from the front of the queue is called dequeue. It decreases the size of the queue.

* **Peek**: Checking the element at the front of the queue without removing it is called peek. It provides access to the element without modifying the queue.

* **Empty Queue**: If the queue has no elements, it is considered empty.
