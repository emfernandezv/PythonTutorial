# Introduction to Queue
## FIFO (First-In-First-Out) principle:
The FIFO (First-In-First-Out) principle is a fundamental concept in queue data structures. It means that the element that is added first to the queue is the first one to be removed.

Imagine standing in line at a ticket counter. The person who arrives first and joins the line is the one who will be served first. Similarly, in a queue data structure, the element that is enqueued (added to the rear) first will be dequeued (removed from the front) first.

The FIFO principle ensures that elements in the queue are processed in the order they arrived, just like serving people in the order they joined a queue. It maintains fairness and preserves the relative order of elements. This property is important in many applications where processing elements in the order of their arrival is essential for the correct functioning of a system or algorithm.
