# **Python Data Structure Tutorial**

## **Introduction**

Welcome to the Python Data Structure tutorial! This tutorial will provide you with a comprehensive overview of three fundamental data structures in Python to build a efficient and robust solutions!

In this tutorial, we will dive into each data structure, discussing their definitions, characteristics, and various operations that can be performed on them. We will explore how to implement these data structures using Python and cover their practical applications in real-world scenarios.

The three data structures covered in this tutorial are:

1. [Queue](1-Queue.md)
2. [LinkedList](2-LinkedList.md)
3. [Tree](3-Tree.md)



Let's begin the exciting journey into Python data structures and unlock the power of organizing and manipulating data efficiently!
